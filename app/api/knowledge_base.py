    Upload historical documents (Excel files) with associated sectors and technologies.
    
    This endpoint allows users to upload Excel files containing historical
    questionnaire data along with metadata about sectors and technologies.
    The uploaded documents are processed and stored in the knowledge base
    for future AI model training and reference.
    
    Args:
        file: Excel file containing historical questionnaire data (required)
        sectors: JSON string array of sectors associated with the document (required)
        technologies: JSON string array of technologies associated with the document (required)
        description: Optional description of the document content
        current_user: The authenticated user making the request
        
    Returns:
        DocumentUploadResponse containing upload confirmation and processed metadata
        
    Raises:
        HTTPException: 400 if file format is invalid or required data is missing
        HTTPException: 401 if user is not authenticated
        HTTPException: 413 if file size exceeds maximum allowed limit
        HTTPException: 422 if validation fails (invalid JSON format, file type, etc.)
        HTTPException: 500 if there's an internal server error
