Facts for Sheet: 7- Legal Health Record Req. 
================================================================================

Batch 1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compass Group's vending machine systems do not require or support electronic signatures. This functionality is not applicable to their current vending machine operations and technology infrastructure.


Batch 2:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compass Group's vending machine operations do not require electronic signatures. The company's systems and processes for vending machines are designed to operate without the need for electronic signature functionality, which includes author name, credentials, date, and time of signature. This reflects the nature of Compass Group's vending machine business model and its technological infrastructure in this specific area of operations.


Batch 3:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compass Group does not have an integration process with Virtua's electronic health record systems. The company's systems and workflows are designed to operate independently without direct integration to external healthcare providers' electronic health records.

Compass Group's systems do not include alerts for failed integration processes with Virtua's electronic health records, as there is no such integration in place. The company's technology infrastructure is self-contained and does not rely on external health record system connections for its core operations.


Batch 4:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compass Group does not handle document versioning, addendums, late entries, or corrections in their legal health record system. The company's processes and technologies do not include functionality for managing different versions of documents or making modifications to existing records within their legal health record management practices.


Batch 5:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compass Group does not have a system in place for automatically sending revised documents to interfaced systems when new versions are created. This functionality is not applicable to their current document management and interfacing processes, indicating that any updates to records after interfacing with other systems would likely require manual intervention or alternative procedures to ensure data consistency across systems.


Batch 6:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compass Group does not have a process in place for correcting true errors in medical records, such as removing another patient's name from a narrative note to avoid HIPAA violations. The company's response indicates that this scenario is not applicable to their operations, suggesting they may not handle or maintain medical records that would require such error correction procedures.


Batch 7:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compass Group does not maintain a legal health record system. The company's operations and technologies do not involve systems that store or manage legal health records, and therefore there are no associated limitations or technical requirements related to the retention of such records. This includes any considerations for software or hardware upgrades that might be necessary for long-term record retention, such as those required by New Jersey's minimum 10-year retention policy for health records after the most recent patient visit.


Batch 8:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compass Group does not have limitations or processes related to converting clinical information to another system in the event of system decommissioning.

Batch 9:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compass Group does not maintain a legal health record system separate from Virtua's legal health record. The company's systems are designed to interface with Virtua's legal health record rather than maintaining an independent legal health record. This approach ensures that all health record data is centralized and managed within Virtua's established system.

Batch 12:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Batch 13:
